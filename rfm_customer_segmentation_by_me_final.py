#### 7. **Conclusion**

### Reason for Choosing this Dataset ?

- The Reason behind choosing this model is my Personal Interest to explore various Domains out there.

- RFM analysis is the key to understand Customer Behavior.

### RFM Customer segmentation :

   - **RECENCY (R)**: Time since last purchase.</b>
   - **FREQUENCY (F)**: Total number of purchases.
   - **MONETARY VALUE (M)**: Total monetary value.<b>

### Attribute Info :

- InvoiceNo : Purchase Invoice
- StockCode : Stock code derives a product identifier
- Description : Product name / description
- Quantity : Number of units customer opted for
- InvoiceDate : Purchase date / Date of invoice generation.
- UnitPrice : Price of Product
- CustomerID : Unique Indentifier for Customer
- Country : Country of Origin where Retail Outlet is Located

### Objective :

The goal of RFM Analysis is to segment/group customers based on their buying behavior. We need to understand the historical behavior of individual customers for each RFM factor. We then rank customers based on each individual RFM factor, and finally pull all the factors together to create RFM segments for targeted marketing. 

### Questions Arising :

- Can you identify your best customers?
- Do you know who your worst customers are?
- Do you know which customers you just lost, and which ones you’re about to lose?
- Can you identify loyal customers who buy often, but spend very little?
- Can you target customers who are willing to spend the most at your store?

 - **Cluster 3** is highly affecting our Monetary value and Frequency and also they are recent, we can say the Cluster 3 contains our **Big Spenders** to which we can target expensive products.


 - **Cluster 2** is decent, its affect on Monetary value is good. We can provide them reasonable discounts and offers to keep them involved in purchase activity. Most of the customers have bad Recency so we can try to get them again before we tend to lose them. Although, They are our **Best Customers.**


 - **Cluster 1** is interesting. Their recency varies from best to bad. They don't spend much. They are combination of **Loyal Joes, Almost Lost Customers & Lost Customers**. We can try to give them good discounts / attractive offers pushing them to spend more.


 - **Cluster 0** contains our **Loyal Customers** their recency is very nice, they don't spend much so we'll have to provide them good discounts & attractive offers.

- **By this we conclude our RFM Analysis. We cannot neglect any cluster because they are our source of revenue.
